# 2-sum
The program visualizes the Two-Sum Algorithm using Pygame. 
It iteratively checks pairs of numbers in an array to find two indices whose values add up to a given target. 
The process is visually represented with animations, highlighting the current index, dictionary updates, and displaying the result when a match is found.
